-topic-nmap

what and why is stealth scanning(-sS)

SYN SYNACK ACK
SYN SYNACK ACK happens in normal connection where we say let me connet(syn) server says i have this open port(synack) but instead of connecting with server(ack) we say we were just joking(RST)

nmap -T4- -p- -A (for scanning TCP)
nmap -sU -T4- -p -A (for scanning UDP)

-T4 = speed
-p- = want to scann all ports(if -p- is not included it scanns top ports)
-p = scans top 1000 ports
-A = everything(i want to scan everything and tell every info like version info and etc)

nmap -T4- -p- -A
